## Indicators to Monitor

Fetch these in order. Each has a URL, timing, and bull/bear thresholds.

### 1. SOFR Rate
- **URL**: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SOFR
- **Timing**: Available daily (prior day's rate)
- **Bullish**: SOFR trending lower over past 5 days
- **Bearish**: SOFR trending higher over past 5 days
- **Why it matters**: SOFR is the overnight funding rate. Rising SOFR tightens liquidity → bearish for risk assets. Falling SOFR loosens conditions → bullish.

### 2. U.S. 2-Year Yield
- **URL**: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-US02Y/
- **Bullish**: Below 4.18%
- **Bearish**: Above 4.30%
- **Why it matters**: The 2Y is most sensitive to Fed policy expectations. Rising 2Y = market pricing in higher rates longer → headwind for equities, especially growth/tech.

### 3. U.S. 10-Year Yield
- **URL**: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-US10Y/
- **Bullish**: Below 4.35%
- **Bearish**: Above 4.50%
- **Why it matters**: The 10Y drives equity discount rates and mortgage rates. Above 4.50% historically creates pressure on the Mag 7 (high-duration assets).

### 4. Fed Rate Cut Odds (Polymarket)
- **URL**: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-december
- **Timing**: Check at market open (8:00 AM ET)
- **Bullish**: Cut probability above 65%
- **Bearish**: Cut probability below 55%
- **Why it matters**: Equity rally is partly priced on rate cut expectations. A sudden shift in cut odds moves QQQ/SPY fast.

### 5. Cleveland Fed PCE Nowcast
- **URL**: https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting
- **Timing**: Check at 8:30 AM ET (or whenever updated)
- **Bullish**: Nowcast below current consensus PCE estimate
- **Bearish**: Nowcast above current consensus PCE estimate
- **Why it matters**: If real-time inflation tracking is running hot vs. consensus, the Fed is less likely to cut → bearish for growth stocks.

### 6. Overnight Reverse Repo (RRP)
- **URL**: https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/desk-operations/reverse-repo
- **Timing**: Published ~1:15 PM ET
- **Bullish**: RRP declining (money leaving Fed facility → flowing into markets)
- **Bearish**: RRP flat or rising (money staying parked at Fed → less liquidity in markets)
- **Why it matters**: RRP is a proxy for excess liquidity in the system. Declining RRP = cash being deployed into T-bills and risk assets → supportive for equities.

### 7. TGA Balance (Treasury General Account)
- **URL**: https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance
- **Timing**: Published ~4:00 PM ET (prior day's data)
- **Bullish**: TGA balance below $900B
- **Bearish**: TGA balance above $925B
- **Why it matters**: When Treasury runs down the TGA (spends money), it injects liquidity into the banking system → bullish for risk. When TGA rises, it drains liquidity.

### 8. News Flow / Squawk (FinancialJuice)
- **URL**: https://www.financialjuice.com/home
- **Timing**: All day — most critical 8:00–10:00 AM ET, and around major data releases
- **Bullish**: Dovish Fed commentary, weak economic data (bad news is good news), easing geopolitical pressure, short squeeze setups
- **Bearish**: Hawkish Fed speak, hotter-than-expected inflation/jobs data, geopolitical escalation, credit stress headlines
- **See**: `financialjuice-agent.md` for how to fetch and use this data
